AJAX is not a programming language. <br>


AJAX is a technique for accessing web servers from a web page.<br>


AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.<br>

<br>
The readyState property holds the status of the XMLHttpRequest.<br>

The onreadystatechange property defines a callback function to be executed when the readyState changes.<br>

The status property and the statusText properties hold the status of the XMLHttpRequest object.

<b> GET OR POST <b>
GET is simpler and faster than POST, and can be used in most cases.

However, always use POST requests when:

A cached file is not an option (update a file or database on the server).
Sending a large amount of data to the server (POST has no size limitations).
Sending user input (which can contain unknown characters), POST is more robust and secure than GET.
